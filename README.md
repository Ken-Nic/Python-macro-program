## Reason
 I have a lot of txt files on my computer at any given point in time that I often refer back to. The problem with having so many txt files is that im left with a lot of them either sitting on my desktop blocking my adorable shiba background. Or I have layers of directory folders each nicely holding text files in groups. Which is still a problem because I now have to navigate all those directory folders to get to what ever text file I want for each and every text file. To remedy this I made this program which saves where files are located and can open them for the user with a click of a button. So all I need to do is assign files to a group and call them when needed. Keeping everything organzied and mess free.
